docker create the environment where we can run our application , it is open source tool , made by dot cloud 
virtualization vs containerization -> in virtualization we use v.m and in contanirization we use docker ,podma ,containerd
docker engin use host operating system to run app , it is very light weight 
docker architecture -> docker engin - 
                    -> docker demon - it help to manage the containers -> demon use container d  in backed -> it is a tool  
                    -> docker cli -  command line interface 
                    -> docker client -> it communicate with demon and engin 


-> sudo systemctl status docker -check status 
-> sudo usermod -aG docker $USER -for adding user to docker 
-> newgrp docker - for refreshing the system after adding user  
-> docker ps -show all contaier list 
-> docker images -show all the images 
-> docker login -login 
-> for login using personal access token -> your profile > account setting > persnal access token > paste it in terminal
-> dockerfile-> docker image -> container
-> docker pull hello-world -for download sample image from internet 
-> docker run hello-world - for running the image 
-> docker rmi image-name -delete images 
-> docker stop container-id -stop the container 
-> docker start container-id -start the container 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
make a docker file -it is the file in which a set of instruction is available
-> create a folder name "project " and open it in terminal 
-> clone a project from git hub 
-> open the folder in terminal 
-> create a file name "Dockerfile" 
------------------------------------this is for java 
# stable official Java runtime base image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine

# metadata
LABEL maintainer="your-email@example.com"
LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL description="A simple Java application"

# working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy source code into the container
COPY src/Main.java /app/Main.java

# Compile the Java code
RUN javac Main.java

# Run the Java application when the container starts
CMD ["java", "Main"]
------------------------------------
-> docker build -t java-app . -> for building the image
-> docker run java-app -> for running app
   ------ if we want to update anything in source code of progeram so we need to recreate the docker build and then again run by using same command 
------------------------------------this is for python 
FROM python:3.7
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirment.txt
ENTRYPOINT [ "python","run.py"]
--------------------------------------
-> docker logs container-id -> it will show the logs of the container
-> docker attcah container-id -> it will regularly show the logs
