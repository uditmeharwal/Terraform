it is an orchestration tool . it is also called k8s
monolyth - it is the application in which all the application included in a single application , it is very hard to manage , it is a single repository 
micro services -it is the collection of different component of an application which are devided according to their work , and incase any service may not working so we can maanage this without stoping the app 
for managing docker relaeted service we use kubernetes 
In this we can handel many coontainers or we can say we are working on a cluster 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Architecture of kubernetes--
scheduler - it manage all time related activites and manage all schedules 
api server -it help to  communicate with worker leve 
controller manager - it is the head manager and manage all the activities 
pods -pods is the place where containers are running 
etcd - it is the database of the kubernetes
kublet - low level manager , it work as worker node 
service proxy 
kubectl - help to control and instruct to hole cluster 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
kubernetes cluster 
-> kubeadm - we use two or more instance and attach them together and make a cluster , it is very expensive  
-> minikube (local system )
-> kind cluster -> kubernetes in docker 
-> EKS /AKS -> Elastic kubernetes service it is online cloud service 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
kind cluster 
-> create an instance in aws and ssh it in system 
-> open kubestarter repositary in git hub and open kind cluster 
-> create a file install.sh and paste the command in it and give them full prmission and  run it in system 
-> install docker in your system 
-> kubectl version -> show version 
-> kind --version -> show version 
-> now create a kubernetes cluster 
-> check second step in git repo and create a config.yml file and paste the code for cluster in it 
-> 
---------------------------------------
